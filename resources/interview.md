### The Coding Interview

*******

#### Behavioral Questions

These can be from work or life in general, they should be specific and focused
to keep the attention on the question at hand.  They can be answered in this
general format.

- Nugget: a concise summary of what occurred
  - Situation: The issue that required action
  - Action: The action that you took toward resolving the issue
  - Result: How this helped the issue

If you think about it, this is basically how you tell a story, you give the
person a synopsis and you see if they are interested in what you are talking
about then you fill in the details, try to get them to understand the deeper
meaning of the story.

#### Testing

As a coder you are general not required to be able to do testing, because for
most part you will have a department that does that for you.  However, more and
more with TDD and BDD the coder is the tester.  Even if you are not writing your
own tests a good way to understand and communicate an idea is through tests.

How would you test a rock?

How would you test a tree?

How would you test a blade of grass?

#### Different Coding languages

There is Javascript obviously, we've used javascript, but many employers will want
to know that you have at least taken a look at some other things.  Do few courses
in C# or another strongly typed language.  Look for opportunities to use python
or any other language.  It's not too much of an issue at least have a passing
idea of what you might run into:

#### Past Work Experience

While you might not have any relevant past work experience, you might have
something that defines how you would approach a programming problem and you will
definitely have an example of working with people or how you might work in a
group.
