# Sound

Let's not forget about sound. For a long time, audio on the web has been considered a nuisance, and is therefore avoided. This is not because sound on the web is evil and should be avoided absolutely, but I believe it is more this:

*When sound is done right, you can hardly tell.*

We have all been to a bad MySpace-era website and experienced the dreaded autoplay sound file. We have all seen bad examples, but we don't give enough attention to the good examples of sound in UI and UX design.

Sound plays an incredibly important part in the background of all of the apps we use. Open up any app on your phone. Try Facebook or Twitter. Pull down on the news feed to refresh the page. Did you hear a little *chirp*?

Let's all agree: subtlety is important. Our challenge is using sound in a way that enhances an experience, but doesn't distract from it.

## Exercise

Now this isn't the ultimate example of subtlety, but this should get you started playing with sound on the web.
