# Tuesday, April 4th

We are once again focusing on JQuery, JavaScript, and building our foundational understanding of these technologies. We will also discuss the DOM and discuss some debugging tools, and focus on viewing our code through the lens of semantics and readability.

* Standup
* Improv (storytelling)
* Ed’s talk
    * Asking questions
* Going over JQuery and JavaScript.
    * Sharing P5.js sketches
    * Talking about what is going well with JQuery, what isn’t, etc.
* JQuery Todo App (Mob Programming)
    * What does a todo list application need?
        * A list of tasks, and checkboxes
        * Another list of all completed tasks?
        * What might enhance these basics?
            * Visual affirmation
    * Set up the structure
        * What is the DOM?
        * How can I debug these things in browser?
        * Planning your DOM, naming and organizing classes and ID’s.
            * Semantics and HTML, CSS.
                * Your code should be easily *read*.
    * Setting up JQuery
        * How do we tell if a task is complete?
        * Where does that task go when it’s complete?
        * How do we undo a completed task?
        * How does your code *read*?
        * Did you do this in the simplest way possible?
            * Programmers axiom: Never write the same thing twice.
* By Thursday, continue with your JQuery todo app, add a form element to create new tasks.

## Assignment

What I want everyone to do is continue with their groups. You will need ONE project repository, with each of the team members listed as a collaborator on the project.
