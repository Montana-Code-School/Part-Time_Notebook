# Tuesday, March 28th

This week, we will be focusing on a continued building of our JavaScript knowledge. You’ll also be introduced to mob programming, which is a method that we will be using throughout this class.

* Standup (:10) (Glad? Sad? Excited? Afraid?)
* Improv (http://improvencyclopedia.org/games//Greetings.html) (:10)
* Go over JSBasics assignment using mob programming (1:30)
    * Three stations
    * Driver: One person sits at keyboard, and translates the spoken word into code
    * Navigator: The rest will gather around and guide the driver. They discuss what needs to be done, how it will be accomplished
    * For now, we will just do 5 minute rotations, but with other projects, we will more likely do 15 minute rotations.
* Go over questions about JSBasics together
    * https://github.com/Montana-Code-School/JSBasics
    * Using MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
* Quick toy assignment
    * JSFiddle https://jsfiddle.net/
    * Create a method that takes in a number and returns a number
    * Create a for loop within it, that has the condition of ( i < 10), and have the number variable increase with each iteration.
    * With each iteration, push the number into an array, and after the loop, return the array.
    * Now, only push even numbers into the array.
* Discuss what we need to do to submit our website projects. (:20)
* Assignments:
    * Turn in your introduction website by Thursday
    * https://flukeout.github.io
    * JavaScript FizzBuzz

## Using resources

It’s *expected* of you that you won’t remember all of the methods that you learn. You don’t need to, that’s more trouble than it’s worth. Programming isn’t nearly as much about memorization as it is about knowing how to approach a problem, and know how to search for solutions.

As a programmer, before you ask a question, you always want to check the documentation first. Sites like Stack Overflow can be incredibly strict about this. Try to ask others if you can't find an answer in the documentation, or if your question hasn't already been answered on Stack Overflow.

A few of the resources that I want you all to explore are:

[**MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

[**Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com)

[**W3Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com)

## Turning in our Intro website assignment

I want all of you to fork the [Simple-HTML-Site](https://github.com/Montana-Code-School/Simple-HTML-Site) repository if you haven't already. Once you have that, organize your project files within that repository in a way that is similar to how I have the sample site organized.

Once you are finished with getting your site running, commit and push your finished site to your forked repository. Before class on Thursday, I will check your site and give you some feedback.

## GOOD LUCK!
